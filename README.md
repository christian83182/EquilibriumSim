# EquilibriumSim
A physics-based particle collision engine which was used to simulate the effects of changing factors such as temperature and pressure in an equillibrium reaction. It provides a GUI simulation, but contains no graphical way to change any of the facotrs. Automatically measures when the simulation has reached equilibrium using the stndard deviation over time of the equilibrium quotient. 

This was used as the foundation for a Chemistry Internal Assesement for the International Baccalaureate program at Warminster School.
